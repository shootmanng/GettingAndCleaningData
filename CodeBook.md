The variables have the same names as noted in the original datasets "features.txt" file from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones,
appended with "AverageOf_" to denote they are averages of those values from the original data set.
More info about the original variables can be found in the "features_info.txt" file
from the original data set. The variables of the outputted tidy table are as follows:

"Participant_ID" "Activity" "AverageOf_tBodyAcc-mean()-X" "AverageOf_tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "AverageOf_tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "AverageOf_tGravityAcc-mean()-X" "AverageOf_tGravityAcc-mean()-Y" "AverageOf_tGravityAcc-mean()-Z" "AverageOf_tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "AverageOf_tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "AverageOf_tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "AverageOf_tBodyGyro-mean()-X" "AverageOf_tBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "AverageOf_tBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "AverageOf_tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X" "AverageOf_tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y" "AverageOf_tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z" "AverageOf_tBodyAccMag-mean()" "AverageOf_tGravityAccMag-mean()" "AverageOf_tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "AverageOf_tBodyGyroMag-mean()" "AverageOf_tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "AverageOf_fBodyAcc-mean()-X" "AverageOf_fBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "AverageOf_fBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "AverageOf_fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-X" "AverageOf_fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Y" "AverageOf_fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Z" "AverageOf_fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "AverageOf_fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "AverageOf_fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "AverageOf_fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-X" "AverageOf_fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Y" "AverageOf_fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Z" "AverageOf_fBodyGyro-mean()-X" "AverageOf_fBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "AverageOf_fBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "AverageOf_fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-X" "AverageOf_fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Y" "AverageOf_fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Z" "AverageOf_fBodyAccMag-mean()" "AverageOf_fBodyAccMag-meanFreq()" "AverageOf_fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "AverageOf_fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-meanFreq()" "AverageOf_fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()" "AverageOf_fBodyBodyGyroMag-meanFreq()" "AverageOf_fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "AverageOf_fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq()" "AverageOf_tBodyAcc-std()-X" "AverageOf_tBodyAcc-std()-Y" "AverageOf_tBodyAcc-std()-Z" "AverageOf_tGravityAcc-std()-X" "AverageOf_tGravityAcc-std()-Y" "AverageOf_tGravityAcc-std()-Z" "AverageOf_tBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "AverageOf_tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "AverageOf_tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "AverageOf_tBodyGyro-std()-X" "AverageOf_tBodyGyro-std()-Y" "AverageOf_tBodyGyro-std()-Z" "AverageOf_tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X" "AverageOf_tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y" "AverageOf_tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z" "AverageOf_tBodyAccMag-std()" "AverageOf_tGravityAccMag-std()" "AverageOf_tBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "AverageOf_tBodyGyroMag-std()" "AverageOf_tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" "AverageOf_fBodyAcc-std()-X" "AverageOf_fBodyAcc-std()-Y" "AverageOf_fBodyAcc-std()-Z" "AverageOf_fBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "AverageOf_fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "AverageOf_fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "AverageOf_fBodyGyro-std()-X" "AverageOf_fBodyGyro-std()-Y" "AverageOf_fBodyGyro-std()-Z" "AverageOf_fBodyAccMag-std()" "AverageOf_fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "AverageOf_fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()" "AverageOf_fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"
